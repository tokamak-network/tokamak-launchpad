# Overview

The TON-Backed Token Launchpad is a permissionless platform for creating and trading ERC-20 tokens on the Tokamak Network. Every token launched through the platform is backed by TON reserves and priced using an automated bonding curve — no order books, no liquidity providers needed.

Anyone can create a token. Anyone can buy or sell. The price adjusts automatically based on supply and demand.
